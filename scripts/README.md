# PLEASE READ

It's important to know that I have not properly tested this format (*.py scripts). This project was made during PharmaHacks2024, and to do so collaboratively, we used a Jupyter Notebook! There is a slight issue being that we did our development in a *Datalore* Jupyter Notebook rather than using a *Google Colab* one.

The problem being, you need a Datalore account to view a datalore notebook. So, as I have more experience in development with Python now than I did before, I decided to split it up into scripts for ease of viewing (*of course the jupyter notebook is still in the repo, but you know what I mean*).

To fully run the entire codebase on our **Datalore Notebook**, it took roughly **2 hours** with paid *upgrades* to the performance. Hence why the functionality isn't fully tested.

## SILVER LINING

In the `legacy/script.py`, you will find code that is a sure-fire functioning script, it is just the code straight from the datalore notebook plopped into a python script (with some added print statements). It's ugly to look at hence the code separation in this directory.
